Gilgamesh and Enkidu are pursued by CorpSec Enforcers after destroying a CorpSec drone.  Enkidu expresses concern over Gilgamesh's lack of subtlety, but Gilgamesh dismisses it.  A citywide lockdown is initiated, trapping them in the alley as CorpSec closes in.  The holographic advertisements shut down, plunging the alley into darkness as the Enforcers' scanners approach. Enkidu worries about the sector being sealed.
