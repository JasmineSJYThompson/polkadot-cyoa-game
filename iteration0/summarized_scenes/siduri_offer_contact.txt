In a derelict pachinko parlor, Gilgamesh confronts the holographic informant, Siduri, about Dilmun. Siduri claims to possess knowledge of this pathway to a transcendent reality but is vague about the specifics.  Enkidu expresses open distrust of Siduri and her claims.  Siduri offers to guide Gilgamesh to Dilmun in exchange for information about his past and loyalty to her cause. Gilgamesh anticipates a price for this knowledge and Siduri confirms it, describing the cost as "tokens of trust."
