A memory node reveals a vision of a younger, pre-corruption Enkidu addressing the player character as "King."  The vision also shows the player character's pristine, pre-damaged form, evoking a forgotten past.  The present-day Enkidu reacts with awe and fear to the image of his former self and the player character's regal appearance.  Overwhelmed by the memory, the player character denies recognition, lying to both Enkidu and themself.  Despite this denial, a buried part of them longs to explore the lost memories.
