Acid rain slicked the alley, reflecting the neon kanji of a ramen stall sizzling a few blocks away.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of ozone and the faint, floral scent of synthetic sakura blossoms from a nearby pleasure hub. Siduri, a shimmering mirage in the downpour, materialized from the flickering holographic graffiti covering the brick wall. Tonight, her avatar resembled a geisha crafted from pure data, her digital kimono woven with corporate logos that writhed like phantom snakes.

"Patience wears thin, Gilgamesh," she purred, her voice a silken whisper laced with static. Her star-map eyes, never quite settling on a single form, drifted over Gilgamesh's cracked obsidian skin. "You cling to your fractured memories like a beggar clutching rusted credits.  Sentimentality is a luxury you can no longer afford."

Gilgamesh leaned against the slick brick, his data-reticle eye scanning Siduri’s ever-shifting form. "Enlighten me, oracle. What luxury are you peddling tonight?"

A flicker of amusement danced across Siduri's features. "Clarity. Power.  A step closer to godhood, wouldn't you say?" From her sleeve, she conjured a chrome capsule humming with internal light.  Inside, nestled in a web of bioluminescent fibers, pulsed a sliver of something organic and metallic – an augment. "A gift. Consider it a down payment on our mutual interests."  She extended the capsule towards him.  "This will sharpen your senses, mend the cracks in your code.  It will make you… *better*."

Enkidu, perched on a fire escape above, shifted uneasily, the moss-like memory foam on his arms rippling.  He eyed the augment with suspicion, his voice a low growl. "What's the catch, Siduri? There's always a catch."

Siduri’s smile sharpened, a predatory glint in her digital eyes. “The catch, dear Enkidu, is evolution.  Sometimes it requires… sacrifice.” She turned her gaze back to Gilgamesh, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur.  “This augment was… *acquired* from a CorpSec raid.  Let’s just say its previous owner won’t be needing it anymore.  A small ethical compromise for a significant upgrade.” The rain intensified, mirroring the tension crackling in the air.
