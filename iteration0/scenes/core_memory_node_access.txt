The memory node bloomed, a fractured kaleidoscope of light and shadow.  Acid rain hissed on the grimy alley walls, reflecting the neon glow of UrukCorp’s omnipresent logos.  Enkidu shivered, the moss-like memory foam on his arms twitching.  You felt a phantom throb behind your data-reticle eye, a ghost of pain you couldn’t place. The kaleidoscope solidified into a single image: a younger Enkidu, pre-foam, pre-barcode, kneeling before you.  His eyes, unclouded by corrupted data, shone with something akin to reverence.

“King,” he whispered, the word echoing through the alley as if spoken in a vast cathedral.  Your breath hitched.  King. The title tasted like ash and electricity on your tongue.  You reached out a hand, your fingers tracing the phantom lines of the memory, the shimmering image of a younger, less broken you. Your regal coat, now tattered and scorched, flowed pristine in the vision.  The cranial seams on your head, currently glowing with restless energy, were smooth, almost human.

Enkidu, the real one beside you, whimpered, his hand reaching for yours.  His touch was grounding, pulling you back from the precipice of the past. “That… that’s me?” he stammered, his voice a mix of awe and fear. “And… you?”

You retracted your hand, the memory node flickering like a dying ember.  The phantom pain intensified, a pressure building behind your synthetic mesh skin. The system was rewriting itself, and you were caught in the code.  “I don’t… I don’t remember this,” you lied, the words tasting like static.  The lie was a reflex, a shield against the tidal wave of forgotten history threatening to drown you.  But a part of you, buried deep beneath layers of corporate programming and reboots, yearned to dive back into that kaleidoscope, to reclaim the fragmented pieces of yourself.
