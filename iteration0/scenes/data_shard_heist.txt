Acid rain slicked the streets of UrukCorp City, mirroring the neon kanji that bled across the GodCorp archive’s obsidian facade. Inside, the air thrummed with the silent hum of server stacks, a digital heartbeat echoing through the sterile halls. Gilgamesh’s data-reticle eye scanned the access points, the crimson glow reflecting in the cracked obsidian of his skin. "ICE grid density is higher than Siduri predicted," he muttered, his voice a low growl.

Enkidu, a silhouette of moss-grown cybernetics and patched ponchos, shifted beside him. "I can feel it. Itching under my skin. This place… it whispers."  His eyes, flickering with corrupted data, darted nervously around the vast archive.

"That was too close," Gilgamesh gasped, his system rebooting from the near-fatal overload.

Siduri’s voice, cold and precise, cut through the chaos. "The shard is extracted. Time to leave
