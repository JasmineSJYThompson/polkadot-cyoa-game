Acid rain slicked the alley, reflecting the crimson glow of UrukCorp’s monolithic headquarters.  Gilgamesh.exe, his cracked obsidian skin shimmering, traced a finger across a holographic blueprint projected from his wrist. The Seed of Origin.  A digital DNA file, the key to resurrection, locked away in Uruk’s gene-vaults.  It was more than data; it was a sliver of godhood.

“A frontal assault is suicide,” Enkidu rumbled, their bio-synthetic muscles twitching beneath a patched poncho.  Rain dripped from the moss-like memory foam clinging to their arms. “Even for you, brother.”

Gilgamesh’s data-reticle eye flickered.  “Brother…” The word tasted strange, a phantom limb in his fragmented memory.  He turned to Siduri, her silver avatar shimmering like a digital ghost against the grimy brick wall. “Your thoughts, oracle?”

Siduri’s lips, never quite the same shape twice, curved into a knowing smile.  “Such charming impatience.  Uruk’s security is a hydra. Cut off one head, two more sprout, bristling with bio-turrets and kill-switched cyborgs. Stealth is paramount.”  Her eyes, twin star maps, glitched with calculating light.  “But even ghosts need allies.”
