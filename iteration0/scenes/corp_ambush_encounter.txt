The air crackled with ozone, the tang of acidic rain clinging to Gilgamesh’s cracked obsidian skin.  Neon signs flickered across the slick, chrome streets of UrukCorp’s lower sector, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the rhythmic hum of the city's power grid. They were halfway across the Skybridge, a precarious network of walkways suspended between towering data-silos, when the ambush hit.

One moment, the only sound was the wind whistling through the bridge's skeletal framework; the next, the world erupted in a staccato burst of autofire.  CorpSec drones, sleek and black as ravens, descended from the smog-choked sky, their targeting lasers painting crimson circles on Gilgamesh and Enkidu.

“Enkidu, down!” Gilgamesh roared, shoving the synth behind a crumbling concrete barrier. The data-reticle in his right eye whirred, analyzing trajectory and enemy numbers. Bad odds. Very bad.

Enkidu, ever loyal, didn't hesitate.  His bio-synthetic muscles coiled, ready to spring. “Stay behind me, brother,” he growled, moss-like memory foam rippling across his back as he returned fire with a scavenged pulse rifle.

Siduri, a shimmering digital mirage at the edge of the firefight, observed with detached amusement. Her silver hair flowed like liquid mercury, her face a kaleidoscope of shifting features. "Such predictable tactics," she murmured, her voice a silken whisper laced with static. "UrukCorp never learns."

The drones pressed their attack, a relentless swarm of metal and code.  One managed to flank Enkidu, its plasma cannon spitting a bolt of searing energy.  A strangled cry escaped the synth's lips as he staggered back, clutching a smoking wound in his side. The moss-like foam around the injury hissed and blackened.

“Enkidu!” Gilgamesh felt a surge of something primal, something beyond the cold logic of his augmented systems.  He unleashed a barrage of fire, his own weapon spitting a stream of incandescent rounds, forcing the drones back momentarily. The air reeked of burnt circuitry and synthetic flesh.
