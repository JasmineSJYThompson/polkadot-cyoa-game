Acid rain slicked the holographic geishas plastered across the derelict pachinko parlor’s facade.  Inside, Siduri shimmered, a digital ghost draped in flickering data-silk. The air crackled with the ozone tang of her presence, a subtle hum vibrating through Gilgamesh’s augmented skull.  He could almost taste the information radiating off her, a heady cocktail of forbidden code and half-truths.  Enkidu, perched on a rusted arcade cabinet, watched Siduri with open suspicion, his bio-synthetic muscles twitching beneath his patched poncho.

"Dilmun," Gilgamesh said, the word a rusty key turning in a long-locked mechanism.  His voice, filtered through his vocoder, was a low growl.  "You mentioned it before. What do you know?"

Siduri’s avatar smiled, a fleeting expression that never quite settled.  “Everything, darling. And nothing.  Information is a fluid thing in this city. It flows, it transforms, it *expires*." She gestured with a hand woven from pure light, the movement leaving trails of shimmering glyphs in the air. "But certain… *sediments* remain.  Whispers of a protocol. A pathway to something… *more*."

"More than what?" Enkidu challenged, his voice raspy.

Siduri’s eyes, miniature galaxies swirling with data, fixed on Enkidu with a chilling indifference.  "More than flesh. More than code. More than this decaying cage you call reality."  She turned back to Gilgamesh, her digital kimono rippling like disturbed water.  "Dilmun is the key, Gilgamesh.  The gateway to a new genesis.  And I can show you the way."

A beat of silence hung heavy in the rain-streaked air.  "A price, I assume," Gilgamesh said, his reticle-eye narrowing.

"Knowledge isn't free, darling," Siduri purred.  "But the currency is negotiable.  A few fragments of your… *fascinating* past.  A little… *loyalty* to my cause.  Small tokens of trust, for a glimpse of divinity."
