The alley hissed with steam and the reek of ozone.  Rain, thick with industrial runoff, slicked the grimy ferrocrete. Gilgamesh’s right eye, a swirling vortex of data, flickered with thermal readings – two CorpSec Enforcers closing fast, pulse rifles charged.  Enkidu, bioluminescent moss pulsing anxiously on his synthetic muscles, braced against a crumbling data port, his breath catching in ragged gasps.  

“Damn, Gil.  That pyrotechnic display back there wasn’t exactly *subtle*.” Enkidu’s voice, a distorted harmony of organic and synthetic tones, held a nervous edge.  He gestured to the still-smoldering remains of a CorpSec drone, its metallic limbs twisted into grotesque parodies of supplication.

Gilgamesh, cloak billowing around him like a tattered banner, leaned against a flickering neon sign, the UrukCorp logo dissolving into static. A sardonic smile played on his lips. “Subtlety is for priests and politicians, Enkidu.  Neither of which I am, or ever intend to be again.”  He felt a phantom throb behind his eyes, a ghost of memory – a throne room, chanting crowds, the weight of a crown he couldn’t quite recall.

The air crackled with an urgent citywide announcement: *“Security Lockdown Initiated. All citizens are advised to remain indoors. Unauthorized personnel will be detained. Repeat…”*  The alley’s holographic advertisements sputtered and died, plunging them into deeper shadow, punctuated only by the encroaching crimson strobe of CorpSec scanners.

“Lockdown,” Enkidu hissed, his barcode tattoo glowing faintly beneath the grime.  “They’re sealing the sector.”
