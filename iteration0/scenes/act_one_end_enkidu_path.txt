Acid rain slicked the rooftop of the UrukCorp data silo, reflecting the city's neon sprawl in distorted, shimmering puddles.  Enkidu, his muscles twitching, clutched the shard â€“ a fragment of the Dilmun Protocol, pulsing with a cool, ethereal light. It cast his face, a mosaic of flesh and moss-like memory foam, in an unsettling glow. "This could save us," he breathed, the words catching in his throat like static.

As if summoned by the shard's power, Siduri's image flickered and dissolved, her digital kimono unraveling into streams of data before vanishing completely. The sudden silence amplified the hum of the city below, a low, throbbing heartbeat beneath their feet.

Gilgamesh, his data-reticle eye scanning the cityscape, felt a familiar hollowness in his chest where memories should have been. He ran a hand across the cranial seams glowing beneath his skin, the faint warmth a stark contrast to the chill wind whipping his cloak around him. Siduri's disappearance, abrupt and calculated, left a bitter taste in his mouth.  He trusted nothing, especially not oracles draped in glitching silk.

Enkidu turned to him, the flickering light of the shard reflected in his mismatched eyes. A plea, raw and vulnerable, resonated in his voice. "Trust me," he said, extending the shard towards Gilgamesh, "one more time."
