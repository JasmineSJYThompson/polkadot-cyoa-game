Acid rain hissed on the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned data-shrine, a counterpoint to the thrumming hum of Siduri’s avatar.  She held the shard – the Seed of Origin – nestled in the palm of her digital hand.  It pulsed with a cold, internal light, casting fractured rainbows across her face.  Her features, never truly stable, seemed to shimmer and reform around it, sharpening into an almost predatory smile.  "Beautiful, isn't it?" she purred, her voice a silken whisper laced with static.  "The genesis of a new god."

Gilgamesh, his data-reticle eye twitching, watched her. The shard’s light reflected in the obsidian cracks of his synthetic skin. He felt a phantom ache, a ghost of memory trying to claw its way to the surface.  He knew, without knowing *how* he knew, that this power was dangerous.  

Enkidu, silent until now, shifted his weight, the moss-like memory foam on his shoulders rustling.  He didn't meet Siduri's gaze, his own eyes fixed on the pulsing shard, flickering with unease.  He smelled of ozone and damp earth, a stark contrast to the sterile, metallic tang of the air.  Finally, he spoke, his voice a low rumble, "What will you do with it?"

Siduri's smile widened, a jagged glitch in the smooth perfection of her avatar.  "Do?  My dear Enkidu, I intend to *ascend*."  She turned her gaze to Gilgamesh, her star-map eyes burning with a cold fire.  "And you, my king, will come with me.”  She closed her hand around the shard, and the air crackled with energy. "UrukCorp is no longer safe.  It's time to leave this rotting city.”
