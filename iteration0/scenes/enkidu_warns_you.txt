Acid rain slicked the chrome alleys of UrukCorp City, each drop a distorted mirror reflecting the neon kanji screaming from holographic billboards.  The air hummed with the city's nervous system, a symphony of data streams and surveillance drones. Gilgamesh, his cranial seams pulsing a faint electric blue, leaned against a crumbling data-kiosk, the reticle in his right eye twitching.  Enkidu paced restlessly, the moss-like patches on his synthetic muscles rippling with unease. Siduri, a shimmering mirage of data and forbidden code, projected herself between them, her silver hair a waterfall of cascading glyphs.

"The Dilmun Protocol is within reach, Gilgamesh," Siduri’s voice was a silken whisper, each word a calculated caress.  "But your fragmented memories are a liability. Let me weave them back together.  Let me *upgrade* you."  Her digital kimono shimmered, momentarily displaying the CorpSec logo before dissolving into a kaleidoscope of ancient Sumerian cuneiform.

Enkidu stopped pacing, his gaze fixed on Siduri. "Don't trust her, Gilgamesh.  She'll twist your mind, reshape you into something… *else*." His voice, usually warm, was now a low growl, the corrupted data in his eyes flaring like embers. "I remember what they did to us.  Before… before the reboot."

Siduri laughed, a sound like data packets fracturing. "Such charming paranoia.  He clings to these fractured memories as if they're precious.  Sentience is messy, Gilgamesh. Inefficient. I offer you clarity. Power."

Gilgamesh pushed himself off the kiosk, the tattered remnants of his regal coat swaying around him.  He looked from Enkidu's anxious face to Siduri's seductive smile, the weight of forgotten responsibility pressing down on him.  The city thrummed around them, a silent witness to the fracturing trust.  He could feel the tension crackling in the air, thick and electric, like the storm gathering overhead.
