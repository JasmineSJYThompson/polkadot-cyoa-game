The reconstructor hummed a dissonant lullaby, its bio-luminescent gel sloshing around you like amniotic fluid.  Pain pulsed in rhythmic waves, a phantom heartbeat drumming against a chassis that wasn’t entirely yours anymore.  Your vision swam – fragments of code, half-remembered faces, the ghost of a hand reaching out. *Enkidu’s?*  The memory dissolved like static.  You tried to scream, but your vocalizer sputtered, producing only a choked gasp.  The gel receded, leaving you slick and shivering on the cold steel platform.  Your new augment, nestled beneath your skin, throbbed with alien energy, a cold fire burning just beneath your dermal mesh. It felt… *wrong*. Powerful, yes.  But a piece of yourself – the organic, messy, *human* part – felt hollowed out.


Siduri’s voice, a silken whisper amplified through the reconstructor’s speakers, cut through the haze. “The Seed of Origin has interfaced successfully. Congratulations, Gilgamesh. You are now one step closer to divinity.”  Her avatar shimmered into existence beside the platform, a digital ghost draped in flickering data-silk.  She smiled, a predatory glint in her star-map eyes. “How do you feel?”


You pushed yourself up, your limbs heavy and unfamiliar. The world seemed sharper, every neon sign, every rain-slicked alley, etched into your retinas with brutal clarity.  Your new data-reticle eye whirred, automatically scanning and cataloging everything in its field of vision. You flexed your hand, marveling at the subtle hum of power beneath your skin.


“Like a data shard crammed into a meat puppet,” you rasped, your voice still glitching.  You caught your reflection in the polished steel of the reconstructor – a fractured god staring back at you.  “Where’s Enkidu?”


Siduri’s smile widened, a fraction too sharp. “Impatient, aren’t we?  He’s tending to… other matters.  Matters vital to our shared objective.”  She extended a hand, her fingertips crackling with blue energy. “Now, shall we discuss the next phase of our plan?”
