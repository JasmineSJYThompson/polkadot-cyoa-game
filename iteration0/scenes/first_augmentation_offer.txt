The air in the clinic crackled with ozone and the low hum of medical machinery.  Fluorescent lights flickered across chrome surfaces, casting the room in a sickly green glow.  Dr. Ninsun, a construct with eyes like polished chrome and a voice like synthesized silk, gestured towards the surgical platform.  "As you can see, Mr. Gilgamesh, your current… configuration… is suboptimal."  Her smile didn't reach those metallic eyes.

Gilgamesh ran a hand over the cranial seams throbbing beneath his skin. The phantom echoes of the CorpSec hit still vibrated through his reassembled frame. "Suboptimal how?" he rasped, his voice a digitized growl.  Enkidu, perched on a rusting examination stool, shifted uneasily, their bio-synthetic muscles twitching beneath their patched poncho.

"Your neural pathways are fragmented," Ninsun explained, her fingers dancing across a holographic display of Gilgamesh’s brain.  "Corrupted data clusters.  Emotional bleed.  Inefficient processing." The image rotated, highlighting areas marked in crimson.  "We can optimize.  Enhance.  Rebuild."

A second hologram materialized, showcasing sleek, chrome augmentations. A neural net interface, shimmering with microscopic circuitry. Dermal plating that rippled like liquid metal. "Consider these… upgrades. Tools for survival in UrukCorp.  A mind sharpened to a razor's edge.  Skin impervious to most conventional weaponry."  Ninsun's smile widened, fractionally more genuine this time.  “Think of it as… reclaiming your divinity, Mr. Gilgamesh."

Enkidu spoke, their voice laced with a digitized tremor.  "What's the catch?"

Ninsun's gaze flicked towards Enkidu, dismissive.  "There is always a cost, dear. A… calibration. These augmentations interface directly with the soul, Mr. Gilgamesh.  Some… emotional dampening. A slight… reduction in empathy.  Necessary sacrifices for true power."  She paused, letting the weight of her words settle.  "After all, gods don’t bleed. They conquer."
