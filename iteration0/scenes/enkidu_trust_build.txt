Acid rain slicked the broken windows of the abandoned data-shrine, each drop a tiny, distorted reflection of UrukCorp’s towering neon spires.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone and decay. Enkidu sat hunched amidst flickering holographic prayer wheels, his bio-synthetic muscles twitching beneath moss-like memory foam.  Gilgamesh leaned against a crumbling statue of some forgotten data-deity, the glowing seams of his cranial augments pulsing softly in the dim light.

“This place…it feels…familiar,” Enkidu murmured, his voice a low digital hum laced with static. He reached out a hand, tracing the ghostly outline of a faded glyph on the wall. "Like a dream I can't quite grasp."

Gilgamesh watched him, his data-reticle eye flickering. He’d seen that look before – the yearning confusion of a fragmented memory struggling to resurface. It mirrored his own internal chaos, a constant reminder of the gaping holes in their shared past.

“It’s just an echo, Enkidu,” Gilgamesh said, his voice flat. “Data remnants. Ghosts in the machine.”

Enkidu turned, his eyes, usually bright with a feral curiosity, now clouded with a deep unease. “But *you*… you’re changing.  Becoming something… colder.” He rose, his movements jerky and unnatural.  “The way you talk, the way you *look* at things… it’s like…” He hesitated, searching for the words. “Like you’re shedding a skin I once knew.”

The air crackled with unspoken tension.  Gilgamesh pushed himself away from the statue, his cloak swirling around him.  “I’m just remembering who I am,” he replied, his voice tight.

"But who *were* you?" Enkidu pressed, stepping closer, his voice a desperate whisper.  "The Gilgamesh I remember… he wouldn't dismiss this. He wouldn't dismiss *me*."  He reached out a hand, almost tentatively, towards Gilgamesh’s face. “Show me you’re still in there. Show me it’s still *you*.”
