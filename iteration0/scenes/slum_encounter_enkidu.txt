Acid rain slicked the alley, reflecting the neon kanji of a noodle stall’s flickering sign.  Steam, smelling of synthetic pork and despair, curled around Gilgamesh.exe’s legs. His data-reticle eye scanned the shadowed corners, picking out the telltale shimmer of a cloaked figure huddled amongst the bio-waste bins.  Enkidu.

The synth’s bio-luminescent moss patches pulsed erratically, casting a sickly green glow on his face.  He looked up, eyes flickering with corrupted data, and a flash of recognition – or perhaps just a glitch – sparked within them.  “You…” he rasped, his voice a digitized whisper laced with static, “I know you.”

Gilgamesh felt a phantom twinge, a ghost of memory trying to surface through the reinforced walls of his rebuilt consciousness.  He knew this feeling. The nagging emptiness where crucial data should be.  “I doubt it,” Gilgamesh replied, his voice a low, controlled rumble. “My memory’s…fragmented.”

Enkidu pushed himself up, his movements jerky and unnatural.  The barcode tattoo on his neck seemed to writhe in the dim light.  “No,” he insisted, stepping closer, his synthetic muscles twitching beneath his patched poncho. “Before… before the wires.  Before they put you back together.  I knew you.”  He reached a trembling hand towards Gilgamesh's face, stopping inches away.  “You called me… brother.”

The word hung in the air, heavy with implication. Gilgamesh’s hand instinctively went to the glowing seam on his temple, a nervous tic. Brother.  The concept felt alien and yet… familiar.  Like a half-remembered dream.  He stared down at Enkidu, the synth's flickering eyes reflecting back his own fractured image. The rain intensified, washing away the grime and revealing the vulnerability beneath.  CorpSec sirens wailed in the distance, growing closer.
