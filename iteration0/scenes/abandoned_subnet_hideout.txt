The abandoned subnet hideout crackled with the ghosts of data.  Acid rain dripped through holes in the concrete ceiling, splashing onto the flickering holographic map Enkidu projected from their wrist. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of ozone and the cloying sweetness of decaying memory foam.  Around them, discarded servers formed metallic stalagmites, their blinking lights like dying fireflies in a digital graveyard.  

"This," Enkidu said, their voice a digitized whisper laced with static, "is what remains of the Dilmun Protocol."  The holographic fragments swirled, coalescing into fractured images: a towering ziggurat of shimmering code, a tree pulsating with neon light, a figure bathed in golden data streams.  "It’s… incomplete. Corrupted."


You, Gilgamesh.exe, felt a phantom throb behind your data-reticle eye.  The fragments mirrored something deep within your fractured memory core.  A flash of blinding white.  The roar of a digital ocean.  A hand outstretched, not metal and mesh like yours now, but warm, flesh and blood.  The memory, fragmented and distorted, sent a jolt through your systems.  You staggered, gripping the edge of a rusting server for support.  "I… I know this," you rasped, your voice a distorted echo of its former regal tone.  "But it's like trying to grasp smoke."


Enkidu reached out, their bio-synthetic hand hovering hesitantly over your arm.  The moss-like patches on their skin pulsed with a faint, emerald glow.  "The Protocol… it’s intertwined with your core programming, Gilgamesh.  With *who* you were." Their touch, when it finally landed, was surprisingly gentle.  "Maybe… maybe it can tell us who you are *now*."
