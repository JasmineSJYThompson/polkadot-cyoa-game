"Six. Lovely," Gilgamesh muttered, the implant throbbing against his skull.  Fleeing deeper into the slums, he stumbled into a narrow, refuse-strewn alley.  Rain plastered his threadbare cloak to him.  A figure, cloaked and hunched amongst the debris, shifted.  Glitching amber eyes fixed on Gilgamesh. "You..." the figure rasped, its voice a digitized stutter, "I know you." Gilgamesh scoffed. "My face is plastered across every bounty board in Uruk.  That hardly counts as acquaintance."  "No," the figure insisted, pushing back its hood to reveal a synthetic face, its skin shimmering with corrupted data. "Before... before the reconstruction.  You called me... brother."  The word echoed in Gilgamesh's fragmented memory.  CorpSec sirens wailed in the distance.
